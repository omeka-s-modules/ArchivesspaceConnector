# ArchivesSpace Connector

Connect an Omeka S instance to an ArchivesSpace repository. Given an ArchivesSpace API URL and collection identifier, import only Archival Objects as Omeka S items OR maintain ArchivesSpace collection structure by importing collection/series/subseries as item sets and organizing hierarchically with corresponding Archival Objects (requires Hierarchy module).

Information about the original item and a link back to it will be included on the imported item's page.

See the [Omeka S user manual](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/archivesspaceconnector/) for user documentation.

## Installation
